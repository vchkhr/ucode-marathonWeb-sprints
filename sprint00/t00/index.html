        What makes a superhero?
    </h2>
    <p>
        What is a superhero? What is a supervillain? What are the traits that define and separate these two? What
        cultural contexts do we find them in? And why we need them? Editors Robin S. Rosenberg, PhD and Peter Coogan,
        PhD collected a series of essays examining these questions from both major comic book writers and editors, such
        as <b>Stan Lee</b> and Danny Fingeroth, and leading academics in psychology and cultural studies, such as Will
        Brooker and John Jennings.<br>
        The following essay by legendary comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer Stan Lee is extracted from
        <i>What is a Superhero</i>? and entitled <a href="https://afpglobal.org/news/more-normal-believable">“More Than
            Normal, But Believable”</a>.
